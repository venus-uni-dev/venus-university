# Venus University

Venus University is a single-player AI-driven dating sim available for web and desktop (via Electron).

The supported way to play is the itch.io page:
**https://venus-dev.itch.io/venus-university**

This is a read-only snapshot mirror of my private development repository. I am not accepting PRs or issues at the moment, if you have feedback or suggestions, please send me an email (listed on the itch.io page above) or make a bug report in the community.

## What's missing

- `assets/characters` — default characters are zipped so you can\'t preview their NSFW images on GitHub. Unzip them before use.
- `assets/sound/music` and `assets/sound/ambient_music` — check `assets/sound/README.md` on how to obtain
- `.github/` — the private repository's CI configuration.
- `build/itch-page/` — the store page's pictures.
- `private/` — the supporters ledger.

and probably some other things. If they're not here, I probably excluded them for some reason or other.

## Running from this repo

- Unzip the cast first. Every zip unpacks to `assets/characters/<id>/`, so from `assets/characters`:
  `for z in *.zip; do unzip -q "$z"; done` (or extract each one in place with your archiver).
- `npm run dev` then starts with the backgrounds, the sound effects and the pre-generated characters; only the music
  tracks are missing. Character generation should work: the pose manifest and openpose skeletons under `assets/pose`
  are included.
- An external API is required to play. API keys are stored in `data/settings.json`, encrypted at rest
  with Windows DPAPI (Electron's `safeStorage`); where DPAPI is unavailable it falls back to
  storing the key as plain text in the same file.
- The browser build (`npm run build:web`) is untested from this repo.

## Building

Requires Node 22.

```
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run dev
```

## Verifying a release

Releases are Windows zips distributed on itch.io. To compare a release against this source:

1. Extract the shipped app: `npx @electron/asar extract app.asar out-shipped` (from inside the
   release zip's `resources` folder).
2. Build the matching tagged snapshot from this repository:
   `git checkout vX.Y.Z && npm ci && npm run build`.
3. Compare the built `out/main` and `out/preload` (which bundle no art) with the shipped copies.

The two builds won't be byte identical since it's missing the music.
